## Oracle Turret Usage Rules

These rules go into effect after October 1st, 2024.

From here on, the word "bot" is in reference to the Oracle Turret Bot unless otherwise specified.

### Moderator Requirements

Moderators with access to the bot pledge to uphold the below <a href="#oracle-turret-code-of-conduct">Oracle Turret Code of Conduct</a>. (Don't do anything that would
get you banned from most servers using the bot.)

By interacting with the bot in any way, moderators certify they are above 18 years of age. The bot is frequently
used to share evidence for bans that may not be appropriate for minors to view.

### Guild Requirements

Guilds using the bot must be Portal-related (e.g. map-making, speedrunning, general community focus, etc.)
The meaning of "Portal-related" is nebulous, and in cases where it is uncertain if a server is Portal-related
or not, the answer should be in the affirmative.

Guilds using the bot must have &ge;100 members. Guilds with &lt;100 members will not benefit from using the bot,
and any troublemakers can be dealt with locally.

## Oracle Turret Code of Conduct

### Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone,
regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

### Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair
corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all online community spaces.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement
(`@craftablescience` on Discord). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

Instigators of these incidents may have their access to the bot terminated at the discretion of community leaders.

### Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 2.0, available at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct.html.
